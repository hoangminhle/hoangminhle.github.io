<br />
I am currently interested in sequential decision making. My research problems are motivated by useful and realistic application of data-driven methods. I have contributed to the development of techniques in imitation learning, reinforcement learning and optimal control. My recent work has been applied to the domains of real-time autonomous camera planning for broadcasting, modeling human decision making in team sports, maze navigation, Atari games. I am currently thinking about ways to integrate more feedback and domain knowledge into the learning process (i.e. the oppostite of tabula rasa learning). 
<br />
I spent the previous two summers working at Microsoft Research in New York City and Disney Research in Pittsburgh, PA. I have been at Caltech since September 2014. Before that I spent two years in Barcelona, Spain for a Master and research in Cognitive Science from <a href="http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/index.en.html" target="_blank">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>. Before that I was a private equity investor in New York City. I did my bachelor in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.bucknell.edu/" target="_blank">Bucknell University</a>.
