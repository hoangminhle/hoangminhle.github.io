I am a PhD Candidate in Computing + Mathematical Sciences at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" style="color:DarkOrange" target="_blank">Caltech</a>. I do machine leaning with Professor <a href="http://http://www.yisongyue.com/" target="_blank">Yisong Yue</a>.

<br />
I'm interested in sequential decision problems: specifically, how to efficiently integrate domain knowledge into data-driven methods. My research overlaps with reinforcement learning, imitation learning and optimal control. 

<br />
I'm fortunate to spend previous two summers working at Microsoft Research in NYC and Disney Research in Pittsburgh. I'm currently supported by an Amazon AI Graduate fellowship.
