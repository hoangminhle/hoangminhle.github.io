I am a PhD Candidate in Computing + Mathematical Sciences at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Caltech</a>. I do machine learning with Professor <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/" target="_blank">Yisong Yue</a>.

<br />
I'm interested in sequential decision problems: specifically, how to efficiently <em> integrate domain knowledge into data-driven methods </em>. My research overlaps with reinforcement learning, imitation learning and optimal control. 

<br />
I'm fortunate to spend previous two summers at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> in NYC and <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Disney Research</a> in Pittsburgh. I'm currently supported by an Amazon AI Graduate fellowship.
