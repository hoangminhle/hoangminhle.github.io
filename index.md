I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> (MSR). Within Microsoft Research, I am part of the Machine Learning research area, with personal focus on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/reinforcement-learning-group/" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning</a>. 

<br />
I previously defended my PhD in Computing + Mathematical Sciences at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Caltech</a>. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Yisong Yue</a>. My other committee members include <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar Yue</a>, <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/" target="_blank">Adam Wierman</a>, and <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/" target="_blank">Hal Daume</a>. My thesis focuses on systematic approaches to combine domain knowledge and learning methods to solve sequential decision making problems, which span reinforcement learning, imitation learning, optimal control. My recent works have been applied to diverse set of domains including robotics, autonomous camera planning for broadcasting, modeling human decision making in team sports, video games and simulated car racing. During grad school years I spent two summers interning at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> in NYC and <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/" target="_blank">Disney Research</a> in Pittsburgh. I was also supported by an Amazon AI Graduate fellowship.

I'm interested in sequential decision problems: specifically, how to efficiently <em> integrate domain knowledge and structure into data-driven methods </em>. My research overlaps with reinforcement learning, imitation learning and optimal control.
