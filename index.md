I am currently a Staff Scientist at <a href="https://lat.ai/" style="color:#e77f00 target="_blank">Latitude AI</a>, a new <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/03/02/ford-establishes-latitude-ai-to-develop-future-automated-driving.html" target="_blank">venture</a> building self-driving technologies. My work aims to realize a new generation of practical AI technology through technical advances in machine learning, robotics, combined with cutting-edge engineering practices to create autonomous systems that are progressively more intelligent and dependable.    

<br />
Before joining Latitute, I was a Research Scientist at Argo AI, and before that, I was part of the Machine Learning research area at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/"  style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Microsoft Research AI</a> (MSR). I received my PhD in Computing + Mathematical Sciences at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Caltech</a>, advised by Professor <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/" target="_blank">Yisong Yue</a>. My prior research work focuses on systematic approaches to combine domain knowledge and learning methods to solve sequential decision making problems, which span reinforcement learning, imitation learning, optimal control. My previous research has been applied to a diverse set of domains including robotics, autonomous camera planning for broadcasting, modeling human decision making in team sports, video games and simulated car racing. During grad school years I spent two summers interning at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> in NYC and <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/" target="_blank">Disney Research</a> in Pittsburgh.

I'm interested in sequential decision problems: specifically, how to efficiently <em> integrate domain knowledge and structure into data-driven methods </em>. My research overlaps with reinforcement learning, imitation learning and optimal control.
