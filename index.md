I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Microsoft Research AI</a> (MSR AI). I am part of the Reinforcement Learning group, led by <a href="http://alekhagarwal.net/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Alekh Agarwal</a>. 

<br />
I previously defended my PhD in Computing + Mathematical Sciences at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Caltech</a>. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/" style="color:#e77f00" target="_blank">Yisong Yue</a>. My other committee members include <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar Yue</a>, <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/" target="_blank">Adam Wierman</a>, and <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/" target="_blank">Hal Daume</a>. My thesis focuses on systematic approaches to combine domain knowledge and learning methods to solve sequential decision making problems, which span reinforcement learning, imitation learning, optimal control. During grad school years I spent two summers interning at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> in NYC and <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/" target="_blank">Disney Research</a> in Pittsburgh. I was also supported by an Amazon AI Graduate fellowship.

I'm interested in sequential decision problems: specifically, how to efficiently <em> integrate domain knowledge and structure into data-driven methods </em>. My research overlaps with reinforcement learning, imitation learning and optimal control.
