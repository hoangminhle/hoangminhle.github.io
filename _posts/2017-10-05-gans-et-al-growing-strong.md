Once more, let's plot the evolution of deep learning in the major vision conferences.
Here you can check the [previous]({{ site.url }}/dl-lstm-gan-evolution) [posts]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-scraping/) [of]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-plateau/) [the]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-takes-over-again/) [saga]({{ site.url }}/deep-learning-evolution/).<br>
<br>
Here the plot using XKCD style, as described in this [blog post]({{ site.url }}/xkcd-deep-learning/), where again we separate the two conferences, as introduced in my [previous post]({{ site.url }}/dl-lstm-gan-evolution).

We see that the presence of these keywords is still growing in ECCV and ICCV, with CVPR slightly ahead; but saturating in both.

<br />
What about the new kids in class (LSTMs and GANs)?

Nice boost! They're already in the title of 4% of the papers, not bad. Will they reach the 25% of the generic deep learning?
